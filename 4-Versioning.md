# Versioning

                       {{0-1}}
**************************************************

What did we learn so far?

1. We understand the general idea of a markup language and
2. We apply its concepts on interactive teaching content.
3. We learned how to use different editors.

**************************************************

                          {{1-2}}
**************************************************

What are the open questions?

> Challenge 1: __How to cooperate with other authors?__
>
> Challenge 2: __How to keep track of changes?__

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kigali

> How does Wikipedia succeeds?

+ Simple context description language
+ Integrated editor
+ Versioning method
+ ...

**************************************************

> But of course, we cannot map the Wikipedia concept 1:1 to learning content!

Course content ...

+ ... is not only text, but also includes animations, videos, and interactive elements.
+ ... depends on specific learning goals and the didactic concept of the teacher.
+ ... has to be iterated in a learning management system mostly.

> Can we transfer the ideas of versioning on our LiaScript content?

**************************************************

## Motivation and concepts

> How software developers work together on a open source project project?

The use a versioning system that allows them to:

+ identify indivdual changes 
+ merge changes from different authors
+ revert to previous versions
+ ...

> Puhh, that looks complicated, but it is not that hard to use. Let's plug a website in front of the git mechanisms.

## Usage of Github

Live Demonstration

## Liascript & Experiences


Starting in 2018 we switched the learning content of our [courses](https://github.com/TUBAF-IfI-LiaScript) completely to LiaScript.

> __I am going to summarize my experiences and usage patterns in this talk.__

### Editing 

+ LiaScript online editor
+ offline editor in Visual Studio Code
