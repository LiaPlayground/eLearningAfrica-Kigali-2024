# LiaScript \@eLearning Africa 2024

              --{{0}}--
Hi, I am LiaScript a Markup language and interpreter for educational content.
The goal of my developers was to create a open and easy to use way to develop and distribute educational content.

![eLearning Africa Logo](https://www.elearning-africa.com/conference2023/ressources/banner/2023/social_1200_630.png)

## Workshop

                            --{{0}}--
In our workshop you will learn to create open and interactive courses with LiaScript, which will include various features in a human friendly format:

1. Creating

   * Markdown-Basics
   * Adding Multimedia
   * Using Animations & Text-to-Speech
   * Quizzes & Surveys
   * Interactive Coding
   * and more ...

2. Sharing

   * via the Web
   * via the Browser
   * via ...

3. Collaborating: Interact with your students in LiaScript

4. Sharing and Creating RemoteLabs

                            --{{1}}--
Additionally we will show you various "entirely" browser-based techniques for sharing content without any cost and additionally learn how to create RemoteLabs, for sharing hardware. Everything you learn, you can directly share with your fellows and it does not require an installation, nor a login, and most things will work also offline.

The film that I saw [[(that)|those|these|then]] night wasn’t very good.
It was all [[ about ]] a man [[ who ]] built a
time machine so he [[ could ]] travel back in time.
It took him ages and ages [[ to ]] build the machine.

                            --{{1}}--
And lots of various other tasks:

                              {{1}}
| Animal          | weight in kg | Lifespan years | Mitogen |
| --------------- | ------------:| --------------:| -------:|
| Mouse           |        0.028 |              2 |      95 |
| Flying squirrel |        0.085 |             15 |      50 |
| Brown bat       |        0.020 |             30 |      10 |
| Sheep           |           90 |             12 |      95 |
| Human           |           68 |             70 |      10 |

                            --{{2}}--
But also for teaching programming:

                              {{2}}
``` js
let variable = 10

console.log("10^10 ==", Math.pow(variable,10))
```
<script>@input</script>

The same coding principles can be used to teach writing, mathematics, and music-theory too.

```
Playing games has always been thought to be important to
the development of well-balanced and creative children;
however, what part, if any, they should play in the lives
of adults has never been researched that deeply. I believe
that playing games is every bit as important for adults
as for children. Not only is taking time out to play games
with our children and other adults valuable to building
interpersonal relationships but is also a wonderful way
to release built up tension.
