Alphabet soup is a noodle soup with alphabet noodles as an addition.
Often, small pieces of carrots and various spices are also added to the mix.
Alphabet noodles are up to one centimeter in size and shaped like the letters 'A–Z' and more rarely numbers '0–9' or the '@' symbol.
Alphabet noodles and alphabet soup have been available since at least 1867 in the United States and since at least 1884 in Germany.
Alphabet noodles are typically sold as a soup addition, and alphabet soups as packet soups or canned goods.
